            <p>The useMemo Hook in React is a performance optimization tool that allows you to memoize expensive computations and avoid unnecessary re-renders. When you use useMemo, you can calculate the value of a variable or function once and reuse it across multiple renders, rather than recalculating it every time your component re-renders</p>
